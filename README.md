This documents a tool I created while working on a simple groundwater modeling project.

In the process, I found that I wanted to have clickable labels overlaying a visual model (thank you "Andy Seery":http://andyseery.com), but I could not really tell where my client wanted the labels to be.

I also knew that I wanted these to be absolutely positioned, based on a percentage of their parent element.

There are a number of instances which document using jQuery in conjunction with MySQL to create persistent, draggable elements. But I had not seen anything using percentages, in particular percentages which switch from left to right, top to bottom, depending on which edge a label is closer to.
